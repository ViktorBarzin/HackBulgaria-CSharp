/*You are implementing a package manager for the new hot language - Java.JS.
This is a Java language that compiles to JavaScript.
There are 3rd party packages that can be installed. All packages are described in all_packages.json.
Each package is described as a key-value unit, where the key is the name of the pacakge and the value
is a list of packages that should be installed first as dependencies.

In your project, there are local dependencies, described in a simple dependencies.json file.
Your job is to implement a simple command-line tool that reads dependencies.json file and outputs what else should be installed
in order for everything to work.
There can be already installed packages, which are going to be located in a folder, called installed_modules,
where each dependency is a separate folder, which name is the name of the package.

Your tool should read the dependencies.json and all_packages.json and output that
the following libraries are going to be installed

	"backbone": ["jQuery", "underscore"],
